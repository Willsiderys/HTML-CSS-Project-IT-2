            <p> Look, I get it. Finding the time to read critically acclaimed novels from contemporary authors is hard to do. What’s worse is feeling like you’re missing out on an abundance of philosophical, sociological and personal knowledge that could help you better guide you through the trials of life. The worst thing, though, is feeling like a dipshit around people who actually do read. This is where my <span>book</span> club comes in. For a small fee, I can offer you the minimum required understanding of these modern classics to go out and there talk down to uncultured swine.</p>
